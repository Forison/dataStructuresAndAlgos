# April Challenges
This is repository shall contain coding challenges I am going to work on this month. Most of these challenges will come from the leetcode 30 day challenges

### 1. Single Number
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

- Example 1
```Input: [2,2,1]```
```Output: 1```

- Example 2
```Input: [4,1,2,1,2]```
```Output: 4```

### 2. Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

- Example: 

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
``` 12 + 92 = 82 ```
``` 82 + 22 = 68 ```
``` 62 + 82 = 100 ```
``` 12 + 02 + 02 = 1 ```
